feat: Add partial-peak solar arbitrage

During PARTIAL_PEAK periods, GridMind can dump battery to grid when
solar production can recover the charge before ON_PEAK starts.

Backend:
- New module: automation/partial_peak_arb.py
- New optimizer phase: partial_arb
- New functions: _check_partial_peak_arbitrage(), _end_partial_arb()
- API includes partial_arb_calculation

Frontend:
- Violet color scheme for partial-peak arbitrage
- Mid-Peak Arb badge when active

Auto-activates if TOU plan has PARTIAL_PEAK periods.
