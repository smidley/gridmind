## Security Improvements

This PR implements critical security enhancements:

### Changes

1. **Stronger Password Requirements**
   - Increased minimum password length from 4 to 12 characters
   - Added complexity requirements:
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character (@$!%*?&)
   - Added `validate_password_strength()` function with detailed error messages

2. **Rate Limiting for Control Endpoints**
   - Created new `RateLimitMiddleware` to prevent abuse
   - Limits control operations to 10 requests per 60 seconds per IP
   - Applies to:
     - Powerwall controls (mode, reserve, storm mode, etc.)
     - EV charging controls (start/stop, limit, amps)
     - Vehicle wake commands
     - Off-grid mode toggle

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Added note about HTTPS requirement in production
   - Clarified that secure cookies require reverse proxy with HTTPS

### Security Impact

- **High**: Prevents weak passwords that could be easily compromised
- **Medium**: Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks and API abuse
- **Low**: Documentation helps users deploy securely

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Users with existing passwords shorter than 12 characters will need to reset their password on next login.**

### Testing

- [ ] Test password validation with various inputs
- [ ] Verify rate limiting triggers after 10 requests
- [ ] Confirm existing strong passwords still work
- [ ] Test password reset flow
